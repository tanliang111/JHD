 * Interface to define an input format for a Drawing. An InputFormat is a

 * Typically it can be recognized by a Mime type or by a file extension. 
 * To identify a valid file format for a Drawing an appropriate FileFilter for a

 * <p>
 * This interface intentionally contains many identical operations like
 * OutputFormat to make it easy, to write classes that implement both interfaces.
