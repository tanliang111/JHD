/**
 * @todo Needs validation and testing.  The DecoratorFigure AnimationDecorator
 *       causes some problems with knowing what is and is not in the drawing.
 *
 * <b>NOTE: I attempted to hide the internal DecoratorFigures that bouncing
 * Drawing uses, but unfortunately the current lack of document-view seperation
 * causes problems with selection and other things.  Normally when you select a figure
 * with a tool, it will be a AnimationDecorator, but we are supposed to hide that.
 * so selections will be the the mapped figure.  Its a problem because  internally
 * the drawing needs to use the animation decorator to draw it.  Its difficuly
 * to decide which methods should expose the real figure, and which should expose the
 * decorator.  In the end I think the decision will lead to a form of 
 * document-view seperation anyway.  So I am not fixing these problems, and
 * will tend to them when the document view seperation occurs.
 * If you are having issues, try using <code>StandardDrawing</code> instead.
 *
 * @version <$CURRENT_VERSION$>
 *  @deprecated Completely does not work in dnoyeb1  no way to hide the decorations
 *              which is required.  I have quite trying to fix it for now.
